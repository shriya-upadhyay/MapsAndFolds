# Maps and Folds (An Overview)


## Definitions

A **map** is a function that takes another function and a list as arguments and returns that function applied to the list ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(higher-order_function))). It can be considered an “apply-to-all”. 


A **fold** is also a function that takes another function and a list as arguments, combines the results of applying the function to each of the elements of the list recursively, and then returns that result ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function))).
